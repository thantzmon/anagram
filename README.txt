In creating the project, I began knowing that I had the most experience using Java and Javascript. Because of that I decided that I would use Java to solve this problem as I had only used Javascript in order to create webapps, and I felt like it was only necessary to make this an on-terminal program. The most difficult part was checking whether the string I inputted was an anagram. Looking up how one would do that on stackoverflow, I learned that if every letter was assigned a prime number, the product of each character would be unique to the word. Using this I was able to make code that would create the unique id of each string. Sadly these numbers got so massive with words such as "zygozoos" that it would exceed the size that even a long could hold. Therefore I had to learn about what  BigInteger was in order to solve the problem. Once I got that to work, comparing them and making the code to create a list of random numbers was pretty easy.
